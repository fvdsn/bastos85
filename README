BASTOS 85
---------
Is a 2d game engine that will turn into a game once
i'll get a more precise idea of what i want to do ! :P

The idea is that the engine is made of particles that are
like active objects. They are responsible of their drawing, movement,
recieve and send events. 

Performance are very nice with 60fps up to 3000 colliding particles. 

Notes about the doc : 
the doc is usually located in the headers unless the c code isn't trivial.


INSTALL
